These are the set of problem statements which i need to solve:

1. I need help in creating a master script which calls all my sub scripts and the user is directly given the information whether there is an intruder attack or not.
2. I also need a way to directly execute the comparison in the Blacklist in case the image fails the threshold value in the Whitelist.
3. How to improve the quality of an image in case of bad lighting.?
4. Is there any way to transfer a file from the Rpi 3 desktop to a linux folder through a python script? 
5. How to keep a check on the name of the image captured such that it follows a regular expression which can be used to refer in the upload1.py script.? Here i am refering the name manually.
